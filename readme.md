## Overview
This repo contains custom tasks that meant to be used with Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Server.

## Uploading Tasks
You need to upload these tasks to your TFS / VSTS server.

1. Clone the repo
1. Install [tfx-cli] (https://github.com/Microsoft/tfs-cli)
1. Run `yarn install` in the root folder.
1. Run `yarn install` in each Task folder.
1. Run `gulp build` to transpile.
1. Run `gulp test-cover` to run tests.
1. Run `tfx login` to login to your server.
1. Run `tfx build tasks upload --task-path <path to task folder>` to upload a task, where <path to task folder> is the path 
to the Task folder of the task you want to upload

The task should now be available on your TFS / VSO.

## Tasks

1. **Version Assemblies**

	This task versions assemblies according to the build number. [More...](./Tasks/VersionAssemblies)

## Changing the Code
The easiest way to open the source is to clone the repo and open in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
If you change the .ts files, then run build (ctrl-shift-b) to compile the .js files.

## Creating the Extension Package
Help Pages can be found [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/extensions/overview).

To compile the extension, update the version number in the `extension-manifest.json` file and run:
```
tfx extension create --manifest-globs .\vss-extension.json
```
